Since I finish the program late and did not have enough time to create the results for 1920x1080 or 1280x720 images, I created this dot plot by using a smaller image (192x108). The following is the dot plot:

The figure shows that the running time is proportional to the number of channel.

### Part C

Since I finish the program late and did not have enough time to create the results for 1920x1080 or 1280x720 images, I created this dot plot by using a smaller image (192x108). The following is the dot plot:

The figure shows that the number of running operations is proportional to the kernal size.
