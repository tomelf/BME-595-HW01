### Part A

The 12 output images are attached.

Input images:
- test-1920x1080.png
- test-1280x720.png

Output images:
- test-1280x720_3_1_3_1_known_1.png
- test-1280x720_3_2_5_1_known_1.png
- test-1280x720_3_2_5_1_known_2.png
- test-1280x720_3_3_3_1_known_1.png
- test-1280x720_3_3_3_1_known_2.png
- test-1280x720_3_3_3_1_known_3.png
- test-1920x1080_3_1_3_1_known_1.png
- test-1920x1080_3_2_5_1_known_1.png
- test-1920x1080_3_2_5_1_known_2.png
- test-1920x1080_3_3_3_1_known_1.png
- test-1920x1080_3_3_3_1_known_2.png
- test-1920x1080_3_3_3_1_known_3.png

### Part B

Since I finish the program late and did not have enough time to create the results for 1920x1080 or 1280x720 images, I created this dot plot by using a smaller image (test-192x108.png). Besides, I only plot the results of [1,2,3,4,5] channels because the program takes such a long time. The following is the dot plot:

The figure shows that the running time grows exponentially when the number of channel gets larger.

### Part C

Since I finish the program late and did not have enough time to create the results for 1920x1080 or 1280x720 images, I created this dot plot by using a smaller image (test-192x108.png). The following is the dot plot:

The figure shows that the number of running operations is linearly proportional to the kernal size.
